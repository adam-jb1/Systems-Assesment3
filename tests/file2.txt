It is an unfortunate truth of security that all programs have faults because humans have faults — human’s write programs. 
As such, we will take some time to understand the kinds of mistakes you, me, and all programmers may make that can lead to security violations.

This is a broad topic area, and we only have a small amount of time to talk about it. We will focus on three classes of 
attack that are very common for the kinds of programs we’ve been writing in this course.

Path Lookup Attacks: Where the attacker leverages path lookup to compromise an executable or library
Injection Attacks: Where an attacker can inject code, usually in the form of bash, into a program that will get run.
Overflow Attacks: Where the attack overflows a buffer to alter program state.
In isolation, each of these attacks can just make a program misbehave; however, things get interesting when an attack 
can lead to privilege escalation. Privilege escalation enables a user to maliciously access resources (e.g. files) 
normally unavailable to the user, by exploiting a program with heightened privilege (e.g. due to setuid bits, or explicit 
id upgrades) to perform arbitrary tasks. The ultimate goal of an attacker is to achieve privilege escalation to root, 
which essentially gives them access to all system resources.

You might think that the kernel has more privilege than the root user. However, the root user is given access to the 
/dev/mem pseudo-device that is “all of memory” including all of the kernel’s memory, and root has the ability to insert dynamic 
libraries (called “kernel modules”) into the kernel to dynamically update kernel code! Being root truly is a super-power!

Each of these topics are quite nuanced, and the hope is to give you a general overview so you can explore the topic more on your own.
